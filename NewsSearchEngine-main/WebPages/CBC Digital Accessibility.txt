We are committed to all Canadians. Creating and maintaining digital experiences that are accessible to the widest possible audience is a priority for CBC. New CBC.ca projects undergo assessments to ensure that they follow accessibility guidelines and best practices. At CBC.ca we are working towards compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 AA (WCAG 2.1 AA), an internationally accepted standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Accessibility Feedback We are always looking to improve the accessibility of our digital experiences. If you have a question or comment, please email us at accessibility@cbc.ca. About Closed Captioning Many people use captions to enjoy their favourite TV programs, but few understand how the captions are made. Most people think captions are created automatically by computers. In fact, captions are created by peopleâ€”highly skilled and trained people. Computers arenâ€™t smart enough yet to accurately caption the content in live broadcasts. Captioning live programming, like news and sports, is the hardest part of a captionerâ€™s job because the captions have to be created at the same time as the broadcast. This video explains how live captioners generate accurate and timely captions under pressure. Watch with Closed Captions Watch with ASL Tips for Browsing on CBC.ca and Elsewhere on the Web Some accessibility features are built into computer operating systems and web browsers. Try the following methods to simplify your web browsing experience. Magnify the Screen Many web browsers allow you to zoom in on web pages using simple keyboard controls. The magnifier allows you to focus on specific parts of the screen, enlarging the text and other page elements. For Windows operating systems, press Ctrl and + to zoom in on a web page (Ctrl and â€“ to zoom out). For Mac operating systems, press Cmd and + to zoom in on a Web page (Cmd and â€“ to zoom out). Customize the Mouse Pointer You can customize a computer mouse pointer in several ways. For example, you can slow down the speed of the mouse pointer for easier handling. You can also change its appearance so that it contrasts more with the screen content.

For example Windows Narrator reads only menus and dialogue boxes, but not blocks of text. Windows Narrator is available in Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8. For Microsoft Windows, software is available that offers more advanced screen-reading capabilities (both free and commercial). A popular free and open source screen reader is NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access). The two most common commercial screen readers are JAWS and Window-Eyes. For Mac users, VoiceOver is available as a standard part of the OS X operating system.

What Is Web Accessibility? The web offers an unparalleled opportunity for people with visual, hearing, motor and cognitive challenges to access information and resources. For example, people who are visually impaired can have immediate access to news articles with the help of assistive technologies such as screen readers or screen magnifiers. People with motor impairments can access a wealth of web content with an unprecedented degree of independence. Estimates vary, but up to 20% of the Canadian population has some kind of visual, hearing, motor or cognitive challenge. Canadaâ€™s large aging population often faces similar challenges. Web accessibility is the practice of ensuring that websites are usable by as wide an audience as possible. More specifically, accessibility ensures that people with visual, hearing, motor and cognitive challenges can understand and interact with a website and its content.
