What is a tile sticker? Our tile stickers are a durable, adhesive backed vinyl film, less than 1mm thick, using the most cutting edge printing technology available. Each tile sticker is then laminated to take some serious abuse. The low tack, re-adjustable adhesive backing make them a breeze to install and will not damage the existing surface. Our Peel & Stick tile stickers are sold in packs, with each individual tile available in 5 different sizes. They are re-positionable but we don't recommend re-using them once applied. Q. How durable are they? We love these decals mainly because of their ease of installation ( you really can do it yourself!) and their durability! The material we print on was developed to be used for outdoor signage, vehicle wraps, stadiums and point of purchase for retail stores and malls. We have just taken this high tech material, printed it with our fabulous designs and laminated it with a heavy duty laminate. Though it is a sticker, it is seriously durable! We love that it can be used outdoors and in wet areas as well. Dirt and debris cleans up easily with a damp mop. Perfect for a kitchen, bathroom, laundry room, pantry, rental home or even a dance floor. We've had clients even install them on a porch! Kindly note these are not a permanent solution. Q. Can they be installed over existing ceramic tile that has grout lines? YES! Our tile stickers are perfectly designed to cover your old ceramic tiles. Measure your tiles between the grout lines & order the matching size. Tile stickers need to be applied directly on top of the tile, not over grout. It's like a tile face lift! Can't find your size? Don't worry, we can custom cut them to your dimensions. Did you know there are several great grout refresh products on the market, so you could have what will look like a brand, spanking new tile job! Please contact us with your measurements and we will happily provide a quote. Q. Tile Stickers or Wallpaper Panels: which is better? Tile stickers go over tiled surfaces. Wallpaper panels go over smooth surfaces eg: walls, stair risers, floors & furniture. Walls: They must be painted in a satin or gloss paint, smooth & non porous. Matte effect paints repel tile stickers & they'll just fall off, so we recommend to re paint the wall with a gloss finish & leave to dry 2 weeks. Floors: Cover a larger surface with less joins - an alternative to using tile sticker packs. Use the floor panels for smooth floors , they provide a better resistance to high traffic areas such as the kitchen, foyer or corridors as they feature our heavy-duty laminate. Q. What surfaces CAN I use your products on? All our tile sticker packs & panels feature the same low tack, re-adjustable adhesive backing. Stick them on any of these surfaces: - Ceramic tiles - Vinyl - Formica - Linoleum - Melamine - Laminate flooring - Varnished wood floors - Sealed cement - Metal - Satin or gloss painted walls & floors. All surfaces must be free of dust & grease. Surface preparation is the key to a long lasting & durable finish. Q. What surfaces won't work with your products? Surfaces that are porous or subject to damp or humidity will not provide a suitable support. Pre treat the following surfaces with a waterproof sealer, paint or varnish prior to applying our products: - Terracotta or Stone tiles - Unsealed Concrete - Raw wood including plywood, medium, MDF & particleboard. - Dry walls, Plasterboard or plastered walls painted in a matte paint. Surfaces that are waxed will not provide a suitable support for the adhesive to stay. Some ceramic tiles feature a factory applied wax film, this must be removed for good adhesion. Surfaces that are rough, raw or heavily textured will show through the tile sticker surface. Ask our advice to pre-treat these surfaces. We've loads of industry tips & tricks to share. Q. Will they come in a sheet or cut out? Our products are pre cut ready for you to install. Tile sticker packs are available in 6 sizes & cut to your existing tile size, just peel off the backing and stick. Panels are just larger tiles & available in 1 size - 60 x 120 cm ( 24 x 48 " ) When correctly installed the pattern is seamless with no visible joins. We can custom cut wallpaper panels to cover kitchen islands, stair risers, shelves & table tops. For easy installation we do not recommend cutting sizes larger than 24" ( 60cm ) . Q. Are they suitable in wet areas? Kitchens? Bathrooms? YES, our vinyl sticker products are perfect to use in areas where there is moisture. They are water resistant. Install them behind the kitchen sink or stove. Splashes of water, hot steam or cooking oils can be wiped away with a damp sponge. Install them in your shower, the droplets of water just run off. Clean the tile surface from dirt, soap & oil prior to the application of stickers. The steam from cooking or showering will not affect the adhesive. However these stickers are not waterproof. Do not install them on the bottom of the shower floor where water can collect, nor in a pond, basin, sink or pool. If your terrace floor is not flat and rain collects in puddles we do not recommend installing tile stickers on it. Q. What is the right tile size? We offer different sizes of tile stickers. Measure the length & width of your tiles & see your size is available in drop down size menu. We can custom design rectangular & subway sizes, contact us for a personal quotation. Do not calculate the grout line or join between the tiles, our tile sticker needs to be applied directly on top of the tile with the existing grout visible. Get ready to fool all your friends, they look like real tiles. Q. Which finish is best? Matte or Gloss? That's really up to you! Matte finish replicates cement tiles & has no sheen whatsoever. The color is softer / less bright than the gloss version. Gloss finish really looks like a ceramic tile. It has a reflective surface & the colors are bright. When installing on floors we recommend the matte finish.

More Additional policies âž• GABRIELLEâ€™S INSTALLATION TIPS: For detailed information visit our HOW TO page - copy & paste this link into your browser https://quadrostyle.com/pages/quadrostyle-diy-videos ðŸ’¡ APPLICATION: Apply to a clean, smooth and waterproof surface. Scroll the images for an image of the user guide. ðŸ”³ PEEL - STICK - SMOOTH: TILE STICKERS TIP â–ªï¸Ž Peel off the backing, position and smooth into place using a clean, soft cloth. Ensure all 4 sides of the sticker adhere to the tile. âš ï¸? WATCH OUT FOR: To ensure your stickers donâ€™t peel up â–ªï¸Ž donâ€™t overlap the stickers â–ªï¸Ž donâ€™t let the sticker edges touch the grout â–ªï¸Ž donâ€™t try to grout the stickers and â–ªï¸Ž donâ€™t try to cover rounded edges. We recommend allowing 2mm on all sides of the tile to ensure the best adhesion. Reposition the sticker as many times as you need, it wonâ€™t lose its stickiness. ðŸ”³ PEEL - STICK - SMOOTH: FLOOR & WALL PANELS TIPS â–ªï¸Ž Smooth floors & walls: We recommend 2 people to install panels. One person positions the panel & smooths it into place while the other slowly pulls away from the backing. â?° LEAVE FOR 24HRS: Leave the new surface to cure 24 hours before returning to normal activity. After this period return fixtures or furniture to the regular position with care. Do not wash or moisten the stickers until 24 hours have passed. ðŸ¥½ APPLY FELT PADS: Apply felt pads to furniture feet, stepladders or appliances that may gouge the floor stickers. ðŸ‘·â€? DURING RENOVATIONS: Take extra care if moving whitegoods onto your floor as these will certainly tear up the laminate. We highly recommend leaving the application of tile stickers last in any renovation. âž• CALCULATE MY ORDER: Copy and paste this link to use our calculator https://quadrostyle.com/pages/calculate-my-order or contact us with your surface details & measurements - weâ€™ll get back to you super-fast with all you need to place an order. âž• CUSTOM ORDERS: Don't see exactly what you're looking for?
