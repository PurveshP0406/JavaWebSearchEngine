Turn it on and we'll ask you to create a PIN. Then, whenever anyone tries to watch or listen to anything with a BBC Guidance label, they'll have to enter the PIN. What are Guidance labels? Bear in mind, this will only turn it on in the internet browser on this device. So you may want to also turn on the Parental Guidance Lock separately on your other devices.
