Say â€œHelloâ€? to the Bitesize Chatbot BBC Bitesize has launched a new Facebook Messenger bot to help parents and teachers find resources on the website more easily. With children learning in different ways across the UK, BBC Bitesize wants to make it as easy as possible for parents and teachers to find the resources they need. Key stages, year groups, subjects, topics, subtopics... it can be overwhelming trying to figure out where to start. Enter the Bitesize Chatbot. From telling the time to trigonometry, spelling to Shakespeare, or habitats to homeostasis, the Bitesize Chatbot will help you find the right resources for any age group. How does it work? The automated bot uses multiple-choice questions to understand your needs in order to direct you to the subject or topic your child or class is learning. It also has a search function which enables you to type in the subject directly into the chat. To access the bot, simply visit BBC Bitesize on Facebook and click â€˜Messageâ€™ or comment â€˜Startâ€™ on this post. Say "Hello" to the Bitesize Chatbot! More from #LockdownLearning?
