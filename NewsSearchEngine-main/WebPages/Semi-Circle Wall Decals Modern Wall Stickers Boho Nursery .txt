You can't buy your own item. Other people want this. 4 people have this in their baskets right now. Highlights Handmade Materials: Oracal 631 High Quality Matte Vinyl, Transfer Tape Read the full description Description â€¢ 24 "semi-circle" decals are included in a set (see 3rd preview image) â€¢ Decals measure 9" X 4.5" each â€¢ See 4th preview image for available colors â€¢ Every color has a beautiful matte finish that reduces excess glare â€¢ Each individual decal can be arranged however you want! ============================== INCLUDED IN YOUR PURCHASE ============================== â€¢ 24 "semi-circle" wall decals â€¢ Installation instructions ============== INSTALLATION ============== I use top of the line Oracal 631 vinyl which allows decals to be easily removed from walls without damaging the paint. Decals should be applied to a smooth, flat, clean, and dry surface (such as walls, windows, tile, mirrors, doors, metal, etc.). ===================== SHIPPING & RETURNS ===================== Please allow 3-5 business days for production. I want you to be completely happy with your purchase! If for whatever reason you are not satisfied, the item can be returned for a full refund minus the shipping charges. Returned items must be in original, unused condition. Please note that we do not accept partial returns or returns on decal sheets that have been cut into. Decals can only be returned if they have not been modified and/or altered in any way. =========== TEST DECAL =========== If you would like a test decal with your order, let us know in the "Add a note to KennaSatoDesigns" field during checkout. Please note: you can request (1) test decal per order. Most test decals are a 3.75" x 4" fox face design (keep in mind, the actual design of the test decal may change depending on the type of design you ordered - but in most cases you will receive the 3.75" X 4" fox face). The test decal is intended to use for the purpose of ensuring the decals will apply to your wall type/texture or testing to see how the selected color shows up against your wall/surface color. Please note: These decals use Oracal 631 vinyl, which is specifically made to adhere to most indoor wall types/textures without damaging the wall upon removal. However, please keep in mind we are unable to guarantee any part of the decal installation/removal process. If you are worried about the decal's ability to adhere to your wall type, or if you want to make sure these decals wont damage your wall upon removal, we highly recommend applying a test decal prior to installation.

The processing time for all decals is 3-5 business days :) U.S. orders are shipped through USPS First Class Package Service and usually arrive within 2-5 business days. Orders weighing over 1 pound are shipped through USPS Priority Mail and usually take 1-3 business days. International shipments are shipped through USPS First Class International Package Service and usually take 2-6 weeks for delivery. Please be aware that there are occasionally delays due to customs, and as an individual seller I am not able to influence international shipping speeds/processes. Buyers are responsible for any customs fees/import taxes that may apply. Will these decals stick to textured walls? We use Oracal 631 vinyl which is specifically made to adhere to most interior wall types/textures without damaging the wall/paint upon removal (keep in mind I am unable to guarantee any part of the installation/removal process). Heavily textured walls may require more patience when installing, but the decals should adhere as long as the installation instructions are followed. You can also request a (free!) test decal with your order - that way, if the test decal doesn't adhere you can send back your decals as long as they are in their original, unused condition (and the decal sheet has not been cut into). If you want a test decal with your order, let us know in the "Add a note to KennaSatoDesigns" box during checkout! Do you accept custom clip art orders? Unfortunately I am not able to accept any custom clip art orders at this time, but it is something I am hoping to get around to once my schedule clears up! :) Can you expedite my order? Yes we can! Message us and we can set up a custom listing for you that includes a shorter processing time and/or shorter shipping time. :) Can I install my decals on freshly painted walls? Newly painted walls should be given at least 4 weeks for the paint to cure before installing the decals/wallpaper. And as always, if you are having difficulty installing your decals/wallpaper feel free to message me and I would be happy to help with any questions or concerns you may have :) Do you take custom decal orders? Yes we do! We are not able to take on every custom order due to the high volume of requests we receive, but you can message us and we'll do our best to accommodate you! What is the best way to remove these decals from the wall? To remove the decals from your wall, you'll just peel them right off. You can lift up the edges of the decals with a squeegee or spatula, but I've found that it's easiest to just use my fingernails. If the decals have been on your wall for a long time (usually over a year or so), they may be stuck more firmly to the wall and may be a little harder to remove. In that case, you can use a blow dryer to heat up the decals beforehand, which will loosen the adhesive and make them easier to peel off. :) Meet your seller McKenna Sato Owner of KennaSatoDesigns Message McKenna This seller usually responds within a few hours. 10,371 shop reviews 5 out of 5 stars Sort by: Recommended Recommended Newest Buyers are raving!

Super easy to apply, although the cutting & trimming process takes a little time, so worth it! We applied these to the frosted glass in our Airstream. Love love the way it looks, simple elegance! Purchased item: Botanical Wall Decals - Modern Vinyl Decal Set, Flower Blossoms, Leaf Decals, Gold Wall Decals, Nursery Decor, Cute Floral Wall Stickers Helpful? eleanor 21 Jul, 2021 5 out of 5 stars I am not good at putting this type of stuff up so it did take me a hot minute, but I just love how it turned out! I did about 16in apart on all of them. I will probably put picture frames on the left and the right side since thereâ€™s a bit of blank wall. Definitely recommend! I ordered two packs and just used a gift card to transfer them to the wall! Purchased item: Geometric Triangle Wall Decal - Tribal Wall Art, Modern Farmhouse Wall Decor, Removable Wall Sticker, Nursery Wall Decor Helpful? Jennifer Frost 13 Jul, 2021 5 out of 5 stars We love our new decals!!! It really made the room. We put them on a dark color wall. We ordered two sets and it filled the wall. It is easy to plan ahead and the kids even helped. Purchased item: Abstract Pattern Wall Decals - Abstract Wall Decor, Modern Wall Art, Wall Decal Set, Unique Home Decor, Gift for Home Helpful? Binnie Jeong 14 Jul, 2021 5 out of 5 stars Love these wall decals for my sonâ€™s nursery! Installation was SUPER easy on my orange peel textured walls and basically idiot proof. I messed up on one of them and it was so easy to remove. It didnâ€™t leave a mark on my wall at all. I will say that the measuring of it all to make sure itâ€™s even took me FOREVER. An entire week to be exact! It still didnâ€™t come out perfect but you can hardly tell. Overall love the product, definitely high quality and I canâ€™t wait to order more for my guest bathroom.
