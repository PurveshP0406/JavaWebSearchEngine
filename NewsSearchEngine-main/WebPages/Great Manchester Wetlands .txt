It is a Nature Improvement Area covering some 48,000 hectares, including the wetlands of Wigan (The Flashes), the peatlands of Chat Moss and Risley Moss to the west and southwest of Manchester, and the Mersey wetlands corridor stretching from Rixton to Warrington. The Great Manchester Wetlands Partnership Creating a living landscape between Greater Manchester and Merseyside Formed in 2011, the partnership is delivering a landscape-scale community and natural heritage programme, aiming to restore a nature recovery network of wildlife sites and corridors. This will allow wetland species to survive and thrive in the face of increasing environmental pressures such as climate change. Bringing together experts from over 20 organisations, the partnership works together for nature by restoring habitats, reintroducing lost species and engaging local communities with the wonderful wetland world on their doorstep. By 2025 the Great Manchester Wetlands will be a thriving, resilient and inspirational landscape that delivers real benefits to local communities and the local economy. What do we do? The Great Manchester Wetlands Partnership is restoringÂ an essential network ofÂ wetlands, which will enhance biodiversity and greatly improve the health, wellbeing and recreational opportunities of the people living within and around the area.
