Version | 1.8.15 On Demand The Current with Matt Galloway Why Canadian nurses are leaving the profession Play Segment19:34 The pandemic has taken its toll on nurses. Some are leaving the profession, while others are burned out, working long hours and trying to provide sufficient care amid staffing shortages. To discuss how we can alleviate the pressures on nurses, as well as how we can attract more Canadians to the profession, guest host Robyn Bresnahan talks to two nurses about their experiences.
