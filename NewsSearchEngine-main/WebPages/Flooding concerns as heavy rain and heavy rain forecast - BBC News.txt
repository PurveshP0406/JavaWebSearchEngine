The Met Office issued an amber warning for thunderstorms on Tuesday. It takes effect from 12:00 to 22:00 and follows a spell of high temperatures. There is also a yellow warning for rain covering much of the country from Wednesday which could see 100-120mm of rainfall in some places. This warning takes effect from 00:00 on Wednesday until 06:00 on Thursday. Areas affected by the amber storm warning including Grampian, central Scotland, Tayside, Fife, parts of the Highlands, south west Scotland, Lothian, Scottish Borders and Strathclyde. image copyrightMet Office A further yellow warning for thunderstorms is also in place for Tuesday covering a slightly larger geographical area. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has also issued 15 amber flood alerts. 'Prepare in advance' Vincent Fitzsimmons, head of flooding and hydrology at Sepa, said flooding was expected to last until Thursday evening. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland the abrupt nature of the weather meant it was difficult to predict where the worst flooding will hit. "Those thunderstorms arrive very quickly with almost no notice at all so the best thing the public can do is prepare in advance," he said. "We're dealing with a very bad combination of three factors - one of those is the heat, the other is source of water brought in by low pressure from the Atlantic, and the third are light winds. "Add those three together and you get intense rain stalling over a particular area - and when you have that you see flooding impacts." âš ï¸?âš ï¸? AMBER weather warning issued âš ï¸?âš ï¸?

Power cuts are also possible and some communities could become cut off due to flooding. Bear Scotland has announced a diversion will be put in place for a section of the A83 - the Rest and Be Thankful - due to the forecast. The area has become infamous for landslips, closures and long diversions. Traffic will be diverted to the old military road from 20:00 on Tuesday. Meanwhile Highland Council said gully emptying machines would be stationed in Muir of Ord and Dingwall as they were prone to flooding. It added council staff are also prepared to respond with sandbags and floodgates to vulnerable properties, but advised all householders and businesses to "remain vigilant" and to prepare. Water sports warning Mr Fitzsimmons said preparation was needed particularly in areas that normally experience surface water flooding and urged people taking part in outdoor activities to take care. He said: "There are three areas we're worried about - built up areas where floods can overwhelm drains, transport routes - don't drive into flooded water - and rivers. "There are lots of campers and wild swimmers and rivers can rise very quickly - you need to take extreme care over the next few days." A yellow thunderstorm warning remains in place for parts of south-east England where torrential rain has caused severe flooding in homes, roads and stations.
