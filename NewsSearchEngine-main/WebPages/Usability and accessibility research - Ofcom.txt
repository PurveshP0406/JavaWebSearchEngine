Access and inclusion The access and inclusion reports focus on issues such as take-up of services, devices, affordability and engagement with the communications market as well as outcomes for consumers in vulnerable circumstances in the sectors we regulate – broadband, phones, television and postal services. These reports focus on consumers whose ability to participate in these markets and society may be affected by factors such as their age, disability, income and their experiences of the communications and postal markets. Access technologies We have conducted a wide variety of research into the various technologies and services available to widen communications access, for example relay services, apps, audio description, and subtitling.

This analysis looks at the likelihood of digital exclusion by a number of different characteristics including; age, living alone, having a condition that limits or impairs their use of communications services, being financially vulnerable, and having more than one of these characteristics. We also provide population estimates based on the analysis, which are provided as a range, with a lower and upper bound. This analysis was conducted using Ofcom’s Use of communication services, consumer omnibus. This survey looks at the access and use of communications devices and services among non-disabled and disabled consumers, and monitoring disabled consumers’ limitations and preventions of use caused by their disability.
