This is the latest Arctic and offshore patrol ship off the Halifax Irving Shipbuilding Assembly line. so the sea trials is basically an opportunity for all the different parts of the ship to get together all the different Contractors on the ship to get together whether it be propulsion navigation communication weaponry to head out into the ocean to see how each one of these systems work together. It's an exciting day. Positive day and a positive part of the life of a ship. However, earlier in the week, we began hearing some rumors some tips saying that there are people from out of province who have traveled here to participate in this sea trial. and so I asked questions I sent questions into Irving Shipbuilding on Monday, a detailed list of questions Tuesday I checked in with them. They provided a three sentence statement saying that the health and safety of their workers is. A top priority and they're abiding by all health authority guidelines on Wednesday. We published the stories talking about the various workers and contractors who would be on the ship leaving on this sea trial later on on Wednesday, Irving got back to us with the information that answered many of the questions that I had asked on Monday, so we had to we have to we are proposing and making a correction. Now we are saying that. A source that we used that I used said that some of the people arriving here in Nova Scotia were from Ontario from the United States and from Poland that was incorrect. Instead. Irving says the people that are going to be on the ship are from Germany, Scotland, Quebec, Newfoundland Pei and New Brunswick, as well as those folks from Nova Scotia and that they will be abiding by all health regulations. That is the correction being made to this story. Now, we've also learned that. The one of the latest people to arrive here to be on the ship actually arrived yesterday from Quebec here to Nova Scotia. They're going to have to self isolate on the ship. They can only leave their cabin to go up and around and go and do their work and then come back to their cabin to isolate there. We also know that four of the personnel aboard won't be spending a night there. They're going to head out on day one on today do their testing as quickly as they can and then come back to shore now the remaining. Crew The remaining personnel will be there for the full trip that lasts until Sunday and so overall beyond all this personnel matter. We hope that the testing goes well and that eventually this latest Arctic and offshore patrol ship gets delivered to the Royal Canadian Navy.
