Itâ€™s a brilliant addition to any home-cooked meal, but with the extra protein from the tofu, it also makes a great midweek meal with stir-fried veg and steamed rice on the side. You will need a round baking dish, approximately 20cm/8in diameter and 4cm/1Â½in deep, and a large bamboo steamer for this recipe.Main course Slow cooker chicken phoby Justine Pattison Main course Chargrilled sea bass summer rolls with pineapple dipping sauceby Anh Vu & Van Tran Starters & nibbles Swedish meatballs with cream sauceby The Hairy Bikers Main course Korean-style chicken with mango salsa by Mike Reid Main course Chimichurri steakby Mike Reid Main course Korean bulgogi chicken stir-fryby Gizzi Erskine Main course Fried chicken, ital vegetables and rundown sauce by Andi Oliver Main course Chicken and chorizo empanadasby Paul Hollywood Light meals & snacks Chicken tagine with orange and fennelby Nargisse Benkabbou Main course Bigos stewby The Hairy Bikers Main course Jollof riceby Tobi Akingbolagun Main course Lebanese-spiced lamb flatbreadby James Martin Light meals & snacks Flamenco eggsby Rick Stein Brunch Shashlik kebabs with sour cream dip and plum sauceby The Hairy Bikers Main course Singapore-style noodlesby Ching-He Huang Main course Sweet potato chaatby Saliha Mahmood-Ahmed Light meals & snacks Prawn laksaby Sunil Vijayakar Main course Fesenjoon by Yasmin Khan Main course Zaâ€™atar cod with relish by Sabrina Ghayour Main course Feijoada by Andre Queiroz and Anderson Queiroz Main course Seekh kebabs with mint sauceby Yazi Bagh Ali Main course FAQs about BBC Food Find us here Explore the BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds CBBC CBeebies Food Bitesize Arts Taster Local Three Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Parental Guidance Contact the BBC Get Personalised NewslettersCopyright © 2021 BBC.
