How Twitter Ads work Skip to main content Business How Twitter Ads work We want to show you ads that you find interesting and useful. Here's an overview of how Twitter Ads work, why you see certain ads, your privacy settings, and other options. What are Twitter Ads? You may see different kinds of ads on Twitter, includingÂ Promoted Ads, Follower Ads, and Trend Takeover. We may show these ads to you when you are logged in or logged out of Twitter. They are clearly marked with a â€œPromotedâ€? icon. You can interact with most promoted content in much the same way as organic content. If you follow, like, or Retweet content on Twitter, including promoted content, your followers may see your name associated with that content. Why you see certain Twitter Ads Your activity on Twitter, the information you provide to Twitter, and our relationships with ad partners all help make promoted content more relevant for you. When you use Twitter to follow, Tweet, search, view, or interact with Tweets or Twitter accounts, we may use these actions to customize Twitter Ads for you. For example, if you search for a specific term, we may show you promoted content related to that topic. We also might customize ads using other information about you, such as your profile information; your mobile device location (if location features are turned on); your IP address; or the apps installed on your device. This helps us show you local ads and other ads that you might prefer. Twitter may also personalize ads based on information that Twitter and our affiliates collect and that our ad partners share with us, such as a hashed email address, a mobile device identifier, or browser-related information (a browser cookie ID). This helps Twitter display ads about things youâ€™ve already shown interest in from brands and businesses that you may like. For example, you could receive a Promoted Ad about a deal or promotion from a business whose website you frequent, or email newsletter you subscribe to. You could also see this business as a Follower Ad in one of your "Who to Follow" suggestions. Learn more about yourÂ privacy controls for personalized ads. Managing your privacy settings We're committed to offering you meaningful privacy choices. If you don't want Twitter to show you interest-based ads on and off of Twitter, there are several ways to turn off this feature: Using your Twitter settings, visit the "Personalization and data settings"Â and adjust the "Personalize ads" setting. If you're on web, you can visit the Digital Advertising Allianceâ€™s consumer choice tool at optout.aboutads.info to opt-out of seeing interest-based advertising from Twitter in your current browser. On iOS 13 and earlier only, ifÂ you don't want Twitter to show you interest-based ads in Twitter for iOS on your current mobile device, enable the â€œLimit Ad Trackingâ€? setting in your iOS settings (precise directions may be different on different iOS versions).Â  On Android, if you don't want Twitter to show you interest-based ads in Twitter for Android on your current mobile device, enable â€œOpt out of Ads Personalizationâ€? in your Android phoneâ€™s settings (precise directions and name of the setting may be different on different Android versions and OEM Android variants). Note: Please confirm that you're logged in if you want to view or change the web settings for your Twitter account. Changing your Twitter settings in your web browser when you are logged out will only affect behavior on that browser while you're not logged in to Twitter. Learn more about how to access your personalization and data settings, including in your Twitter mobile app. Twitter also works with third-party advertising partners, including Google, to market Twitterâ€™s own services and serve ads on behalf of Twitter advertisers, including through the delivery of interest-based ads. The privacy options described here apply to interest-based ads served by or on Twitter; they do not apply to ads served by these other companies off of Twitter, including on Twitter's behalf. You can learn more about opting out of receiving interest-based ads from other companies at optout.aboutads.info and www.networkadvertising.org/choices.Â If you're on the web, you can also opt-out of Google Analytics by installing Googleâ€™s opt-out browser add-on, and opt-out of interest-based Google ads using Google Ads settings. On iOS version 14 and later only, if you do not want Twitter to access your iOS Identifier for Advertising, disable the â€œAllow Apps to Request to Trackâ€? setting in your iOS settings (precise directions may be different on different iOS versions). In addition, whether you're logged in or logged out, you always have the option to "dismiss" Promoted Ads and/or accounts that you're not interested in seeing. This feedback helps us show you better promoted content. How can I run Twitter Ads?
