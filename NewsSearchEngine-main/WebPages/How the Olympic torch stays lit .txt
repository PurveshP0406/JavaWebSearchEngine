The torch is lit in Greece and passed from one torchbearer to the next. In the end it reaches whichever city is hosting the games. It’s not easy! It takes a bunch of super smart engineers to design a torch that won’t go out. Thousands of people transport and protect it. And they have a secret weapon in case something goes wrong. What are the obstacles? Bad weather Torchbearer Sho Endo carries the torch in the snow at a ski resort in Fukushima Prefecture on March 26, 2021.

Imagine how hard it must be to keep a fire lit while running in the rain, over mountains or in a windstorm! Engineers have to make sure that Olympic torches can hold up in the worst weather. That means testing, testing, testing. One engineer even tested his torch by taking it into the shower!

Many torchbearers have suffered an embarrassing fall while carrying the torch. Sometimes the ground is slippery. Maybe the ground is uneven. Or the torchbearer is just a little clumsy. We’ve all been there — of course, the important thing is to get back up and keep going! Goofballs A man dressed as a torch makes it into the Rio 2016 Olympic Torch Relay. (Handout/Getty Images Sport) One of the biggest challenges of the Olympic Torch Relay is dealing with goofballs in the crowd. Some people will do anything to get on TV. One man who ran through the 2012 Olympic Torch Relay in London, England — naked! One goofball handed the mayor of Sydney, Australia, a fake torch. It was just a wooden chair leg, silver paint, a tin can and a pair of underwear! By the time the mayor realized it was a fake, the man had disappeared into the crowd. Torch fails A torch bearer's flame has to be relit after it goes out in Fukushima, Japan on March 25, 2021. (Japan - Pool/Getty Images) Have you ever heard of Murphy’s law? It says that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. (And sometimes it does!) Has the torch ever shot sparks? Yes. Has it ever been too smokey? You bet! But most of the time, the torch goes out or just won’t light. That’s why Olympic planners always keep a secret weapon on hand — backup flames! The relay’s secret weapon A staff member preserves the Olympic flame in the lantern in Fukushima, Japan, 2020. (Clive Rose/Getty Images) The initial flame is lit in Olympia, Greece. It is used to light the torch of the first runner and the relay begins. It is also used to light a bunch of backup flames. These can be used to relight the flame if it goes out en route. Multiple copies of the flame are brought along with the relay or held in backup locations. They ensure that the Olympic cauldron (the flame’s final destination) is lit with the original fire. The Olympic flame is a symbol of peace, hope and tolerance. That is why not just any flame can be used to reignite an Olympic torch.   More Fun! sports moments Most bizarre moments of the Olympic Games Olympics 101 10 big moments in Olympic Games history Gary Learns Gary Learns About Relay with Crystal Emmanuel Terms of Use| Privacy| Copyright| Other Policies| Rio 2016| Pyeong Chang 2018 Copyright © CBC 2021
