GEL | GEL Technical Documentation Skip to content BBC GEL Technical Documentation Guidance for developers building accessible websites based on BBC GEL Contents Foundations Components About this site Coding conventions Related Questions? Foundations Focus Indicating and managing focus is integral to keyboard accessibility Grids Visual layout should be efficient and consistent, without impeding document structure and accessibility Headings Headings provide a semantic and visual hierarchical structure to a document Iconography Iconography aids communication, but should not take precedence over text Routing Route changes in single-page applications need to emulate the conventions of page loads Typography Inclusive content must be readable, and for it to be readable it must first be legible Components Accordions The accordion consists of a number of collapsed sections, each with a button to expand that section's content Action dialogs Action dialogs are presented where the user must choose a course of action Breakout boxes Breakout Boxes interject supplementary content within the flow of a document Buttons and CTAs The design of clickable controls must be consistent with their behaviour Cards Cards let you preview and share content quickly, without having to leave the page you're on Carousels A Carousel is a way to browse lots of content in a limited amount of vertical space, by scrolling a window onto that content Comments The ability to engage with content must be inclusive. Everyone should be able to have their say Data tables Tabular data must be presented with a sound semantic and visual structure External links External links direct people outside of the BBC domain; a behaviour that must be indicated to all users Filter and sort Filters help the user find what theyâ€™re looking for. Allowing the user to refine content by selecting criteria thatâ€™s relevant to their needs Form fields and validation Form fields must be accessible and usable, helping the user to provide valid input Infographics Infographics should be informative, engaging, and accessible Information Panel The information panel is a specialized popup panel for supplementary content and functionality Masthead The Masthead comprises the global navigation and a banner for the local site Metadata strips The metadata strip defines key metadata for an item of content, in a compact form Pagination Loading content must be a smooth experience and under the user's direct control Pockets The Pocket pattern allows the user to reveal longform content at their discretion Promos A promo is a snippet of content which links to a full piece of content elsewhere on the BBC site or app Search The global and local search components each include Share Tools Share tools offer unobtrusive options to share BBC content on social media Site Menu The Site menu is the navigation region for the local site, and can contain two tiers of navigation options Tabs Tabs make it easy to view and navigate stacked panels of related content Video controls Custom HTML5 video functionality must be accessible and intuitive About this site The BBC Global Experience Language (GEL) Technical Guides are a series of framework-agnostic, code-centric recommendations and examples for building GEL design patterns in websites. They illustrate how to create websites that comply with all BBC guidelines and industry best practice, giving special emphasis to the BBC Accessibility Guidelines for websites. Our guides are for BBC developers following the BBC GEL design patterns, including all BBC employees, contractors and suppliers. However they are publicly available for anyone who may be interested in how the BBC recommends building websites. You can use these guides under an Open Government Licence for Public Sector Information. Details can be found on the National Archives website. The examples in each guide are for reference only and are not intended to be used as a library. Coding conventions Our guides make recommendations about the markup (HTML), layout (CSS), and behaviour (JS) of your GEL implementations. It is otherwise technology agnostic. However, the reference implementations inside our guides adhere to certain principles and conventions. If you are intending to contribute working code to this project, please be mindful of these. ES5 All reference implementations are written in ES5. The intention is for the code to be as widely understood, and as easily adopted for creating test cases as possible. In a few cases, small polyfills are included. These are added to the implementation's demo page inside the init function. Progressive enhancement Our guides eschew larger polyfills and compatibility libraries, opting to use feature detection. In JavaScript this might mean wrapping functionality in an if block. if ('IntersectionObserver' in window) { // Do something with the IntersectionObserver API } In CSS, a basic layout is put in place then enhanced with modern layout modules like CSS Grid inside @supports blocks: .grid > * + * { margin-top: 1rem; } @supports (display: grid) { .grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(266px, 1fr)); grid-gap: 1rem; } .grid > * + * { margin: 0; /* undo, since `grid-gap` supercedes it */ } } Namespacing Components are identified in their markup using classes and the gel-component structure. For example, the Site menu pattern uses class="gel-sitemenu" on the parent element, and gel-sitemenu-more to identify each (hidden by default) submenu. Component scripts are attached to the gel namespace, like gel.ComponentName. Constructor pattern Each reference implementation that depends on JavaScript uses a basic constructor pattern to instantiate the working component. For example, the simple toggle switch constructor looks like this:  self.constructor = function (button) { this.button = button; // The 'on/off' text is provided in an aria-hidden <span> this.onOffSpan = this.button.querySelector('[aria-hidden]'); // Set aria-pressed to false if the attribute is absent let currentState = this.button.getAttribute('aria-pressed') === 'true'; this.button.setAttribute('aria-pressed', currentState); // Set the span's text to match the state this.onOffSpan.textContent = currentState ? 'on' : 'off'; // Bind to the toggle method this.button.addEventListener('click', this.toggle.bind(this)); } // The toggle method self.constructor.prototype.toggle = function () { let currentState = this.button.getAttribute('aria-pressed') === 'true'; this.button.setAttribute('aria-pressed', !currentState); this.onOffSpan.textContent = currentState ? 'off' : 'on'; } Note that the toggle function is exposed as a public method, in case the switch needs to be toggled programmatically. Initialization inside the component's demo page looks like this: var switchElem = document.querySelector('.gel-button-switch'); var switchButton = new gel.Switch.constructor(switchElem); Related Did you know we created a related project for Testers? We have translated most of our technical documentation in ACT-formatted test scripts. Questions? This project is currently being overseen by the BBC Accessibility Team. If you have access to our corporate Slack channel pop in and say hi. We welcome questions and suggestions posted to this project's GitHub issue tracker. Copyright © 2021 BBC.
