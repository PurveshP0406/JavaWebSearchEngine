What are we? CBC Kids News is a daily news service for kids in Canada. We aim to cover the topics that kids care about. We aren’t your parents’ news. We aren’t a teacher site. We are real news, for real kids. Created for and with ... kids. Click here to meet our contributor team There are so many news stories out there about kids, but we rarely hear from those kids directly. That’s where we come in. We aim to get your perspective on issues that matter most to you. You can trust that the information you read on CBC Kids News is well-researched, balanced and backed by facts. That’s because we follow the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s Journalistic Standards and Practices. Don’t agree with something you read? Tell us! We’re always trying to find ways to improve and best reflect the opinions of Canadian kids! We’re also a safe place for kids. That’s why you won’t see us link to external pages or social media, unless we’re confident they’re safe. Check us out for trending and timely stories from the day's headlines in news, pop culture, sports, science, technology and the environment.
