Keating's lawyers told a hearing at London's High Court that newspaper stories published between 1996 and 2011 had caused him "considerable distress". They also led to him distrusting some of his closest friends, they added. News Group Newspapers apologised for the distress caused by "individuals" in relation to the News of the World. The newspaper closed in 2011. The phone-tapping scandal engulfed the UK print news industry and ultimately prompted the Leveson Inquiry.
